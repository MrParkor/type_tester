"Mrs. Esputa quickly fetched one of her husband's white shirts. But when Philip put it on, she began to exclaim, "Oh, dear! Gracious!" The shirt was so large that Philip was almost lost in it. Hastily Mrs. Esputa found a box of pins. In a twinkling, her nimble fingers pinned enough tucks in the shirt to make it fit Philip. They both heaved a big sigh of relief when the job was finished. Then, free from anxiety, Philip hurried back to the school. The concert finally began, and soon it was time for Philip's also. Stood up, placed the violin under his chin, and raised his bow. With horror he felt a pin pulling loose in the back of his shirt. But he recalled how many pins had been inserted in the shirt and thought, "Losing one won't matter. "Philip started to play. At first his right arm moved back and forth slowly, then more swiftly. Before long the pins that were holding his collar pulled out, The loose, large shirt collar began to creep up the back of Philip's head. Then the unruly sleeves grew looser and longer. Suddenly the shirt fell away from his neck. The audience began to laugh. In embarrassed confusion, Philip forgot what he was playing and stopped completely. The disaster so upset him that he rushed off the stage and sulked in a dark corner. Fighting back tears, he mumbled gloomily, "I wish I were dead Refreshments were served after the concert, but Philip was too busy to have any. He mingled with the crowd as quickly as he could, hoping to avoid Mr. Esputa. After a wistful look at the ice cream, Phillip was about to slink out when a booming voice behind him scoffed, "Well, Philip, you made a nice mess of it.

    """Now we have devised robots that are much more complicated than any other machines we have ever had. They are complicated enough to do jobs that until now only human beings could do, but that are too simple for the marvellous brains we all have. The robots, even though they are smarter than other machines, are still only capable of very simple tasks - the kind of tasks human beings ought not to waste their time doing. In that case, why not let the robots do it? Why shouldn't human beings do other and better things? After all, whenever there is an important new invention, some jobs are lost. When the automobile came into use, there was a gradual, but steady, loss of jobs that involved horses. There were fewer stables, fewer manufacturers of buggies and wagons, fewer whips, and fewer spurs. On the other hand, think of the jobs the automobile created. Think of all the garages that came into being, all the auto mechanics needed, all the tyre manufacturing, highway building, oil well drilling. Automobiles created hundreds of times as many jobs as they destroyed. That's the way it will be with robots too. Lots of assembly-line jobs will vanish, but think of all the jobs needed to design robots, manufacture their parts, put them together, install them, and keep them in good repair, There will be many times as many jobs coming into being as are destroyed. The jobs that are destroyed will be very dull ones anyway, so dull that even a robot can do them. The jobs that will be created will be interesting ones that will stretch the mind. Of course, there is a catch. We can't just tell a person who has been working on an assembly line for twenty-five years to stop and take a job designing robots instead. It takes a special kind of education to be able to work with robots, and assembly-line worker won't have it. If we are going to have a large changeover in types of jobs, there will have to be a careful programme of retraining and re-education for people with old-style jobs. It will have to be done even if they take rather simple new-style ones. That Will be expensive and hard, but it will have to be done. There are also sure to be people who are too old, or too beaten down by the dull job they had to do all their lives, to be able to take advantage of retraining. Some sort of jobs will have to be found that they can do. Eventually, of course, things will be different. Children going to schools in the future will be educated in ways or using and understanding computers and robots. They will grow up and De able to take the new jobs, and no one will ever consider the old jobs or want them. Everyone will be glad to leave the dull jobs and the dangerous jobs to""",
    """Sher Singh breathed one more prayer, of thanks this time, and scrambled down into the river-bed. He stepped into the rive usual, and deeper than it had been. Sher Singh had to go slowly made ready to move with Kunwar on his back once again. HAn Sher Singh had been to this river often. But it was colder than because of slime on the stones. Thank goodness there was a bridge at the second river, he thought. It was a flimsy thing made of bamboo poles, stones, thick grass and river gravel. But it was at least a bridge. As Sher Singh washed up on to the shore, water twinkled in his footprints before sinking into the sand. Coming up out of the river were another set of prints-a tigers and there was glitter in them too. Even as he looked, they dried. He plodded steadily on, and his body panted and sobbed. Towards midnight he heard the second river ahead of him. He heard it from far away, a steady roar of flood. When he came out on the shore, he saw it. A big head of snow must have melted yesterday and here it was. From bank to bank, the river foamed. He looked for the bridge. It was not there. Only a fierce crest of water showed where it lay, submerged. Branches caught against the bridge feathered the wild glissade of water. Underneath, boulders moved. He could hear the river grinding its teeth. Then a tree, churning over and over, crashed against the drowned bridge, which heeled and broke, throwing up its bamboo ribs like a fan. So, now, how to cross? There was not a chance to swim. Even alone, he would be lost. Perhaps among the wreckage of the bridge, there was a way? Sher Singh set Kunwar down and brought him water from the river in his hands. My brother-the little boy whispered, and drank. Sher Singh gathered grass and plaited it into a rope. He tied the rope round his brother and himself so they would keep together. Then he entered the water just above the bridge. The river seize them and flattened them against the wreck. He could not move a first, then he edged forward into the maelstrom, feeling for the spiuends of bamboo. The deluge deafened him, timber banged and bruised him. as scold he could hardly keep his hold.""",
    """Switzerland is the most peaceful country in the world. Although always prepared to face any hazard of war, it has never faced any hostile army since the Swiss Confederation was founded in 1815, nor has its army ever fired at anyone in aggression. Switzerland is, therefore, totally free of the ravages of war. No other European country can claim this distinction. Most of Switzerland's 16,000 square mile area is a continuous, rolling lush countryside of pastures, Vineyards and grain farms, except one third of the mountainous and extremely beautiful region. Three quarters of the population lives in small towns and villages which remain exquisitely medieval in their architecture and external appearance. At very short notice, it can convert itself into an army bristling with military defence, i.e. a whole nation in arms. People of Switzer- land can boast that they do not have an army, but they themselves are an army. The unique aspect of the military preparedness of Switzerland is its constant readiness for facing a nuclear attack or the consequences of a nuclear war in its neighbourhood. Dr. Morgellier, the Chief military spokesman told sometime back that .80% of the population of Switzerland can be moved into under-ground shelters within a few hours. Every aspect of the life of the citizens is tightly supervised by the local police. As a consequence, there is 100% compliance with three specific instructions: one is that every household must keep a reserve stock of approximately two months requirements of food and daily provisions. Secondly, the entire male population must take part in civil defence exercises and must be constantly available for military duty. Thirdly, everyone must be ready at all times with one's arms. The government issue arms and ammunition to each household. All men between 20 and 50 years of age must do military service and until the age of 32, must attend military colleges for 20 days every year and one at least for 90 days. The result is that although Switzerland's regular or standing army is only 65,000 strong, it can put 10 per cent of the population or 650,000 men in the field within 48 hours and all the rest in a few days more. Thus, Switzerland's concern with defence is such that outside observers describe it as an obsession. Words.""",

But whenever an expedition entered the jungle in search of big game, either to shoot or photograph them, they sent for this man, Bahadur the Brave.

He is too big for you, said his mother. She spoke in a whisper or despair. "You will never get there. Sher Singh said nothing. He set off. It was evening.

    """We learned to see, at long last. Partway through the millennium, we figured out how to shape and polish glass so as to see far and to see small, and we dug into dead languages of previous millenniums to name our new aids to seeing-telescope, microscope, spectroscope, spectrophotometer, spectroheliograph and, eventually, television. We figured out the art, the geometry and the semantics of perspective. No wonder our superheroes had X-ray vision; so did we. And infrared vision, and ultraviolet vision, and gamma-ray vision and nuclear-magnetic-resonant vision. We extended our sight far beyond the tiny spectrum our unaided eyes could handle, from violet to red. We looked out, and we looked inside. We saw where earth is and what humans are (if not quite who we are). We noticed quasars and we noticed viruses. Surprise! "In all falling rain, carried from gutters into water-butts, animalcules are to be found. in all kinds of water, standing in the open air, animalcules can turn up," noted Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the first man to observe bacteria. We figured out some things about color and space. "To myself," Isaac Newton remarked modestly, "I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me." Then-and perhaps most important of all-we learned to see faster. Our sight expanded into the fourth dimension. It started innocently enough, with mundane items like railroad scheduling charts and weather histograms: new graphical representations of time. "Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record," said a famous fictional character, the Time Traveler of H. G. Wells, explaining the fourth dimension years before mathematicians and physicists had worked out the details. "This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognized?" The hero of "The Time Machine" was a time traveler who used ivory levers and quartz rods. But Wells also invented another kind of time traveler, a Professor Gibberne, hero of a little-known story published at the turn of the century under the title "The New Accelerator." Professor Gibberne is a time traveler on drugs-really preparing no less than the absolute acceleration of life.""",
    """Of the many things that the 2020 Delhi assembly election heralded, one that stands out because of its optics is the public emergence of Hanuman bhakt Arvind Kejriwal. In his victory speech on Tuesday, Arvind Kejriwal thanked Lord Hanuman for blessing Delhi and said the mandate given to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has marked the dawn of a "new form of politics" in India. In Kejriwal's words, this newness is outlined by "kaam ki rajneeti (politics of work)" wherein people would vote on the basis of developmental works (schools, hospitals, affordable healthcare, electricity etc) carried out by a government. "This is an auspicious message for the country," he said. No doubt, that's refreshing to hear, especially in a political atmosphere vitiated by a high-decibel cacophony of the worst order. But development was not the only axis on which Arvind Kejriwal's Delhi election campaign rotated on. To mellow down the vitriol of BJP's hard Hindutva politics married to its brand of nationalism, Arvind Kejriwal rebranded himself as a devout Hanuman bhakt who isn't shy of wearing his religious identity down his sleeves; say 'Jai Hind' and 'Vande Matram'; carefully side-step thorny uncomfortable issues like CAA, NRC and Shaheen Bagh; and yet anchor his discourse around development. This careful positioning of himself as a devout Hanuman bhakt in the campaign's last leg ensured Kejriwal that those who were with him on the issue of development and governance, didn't stray away to the BJP on count of polarisation fanned by appeals to religious and nationalistic identities. Having reaped the benefits of this posturing in form of a consecutive sweep (wining 62 of 70 seats), Arvind Kejriwal ensured that his victory speech on Tuesday too echoed the posturing. After thanking the people of Delhi for the landslide mandate "for his developmental works", Kejriwal touched base with his religious identity, lest there remain any doubts. "Aaj mangal vaar hai (cheers from the crowd) Hanuman ji ka din hai. Hanuman ji ne aaj apni Dilli pe kripa barsayi hai. Hanuman ji ka bhi bahut bahut dhanyavaad (It's Tuesday today, the day of Lord Hanuman. The Lord has blessed our Delhi and I thank him for this victory)," he said. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal: This is the day of Lord Hanuman who has blessed the people of Delhi. We pray that Hanuman Ji keeps showing the right path to us so that we continue to serve people for the next five years.""",
    """Later in the day Kejriwal visited the Hanuman temple in Delhi's Connaught Place, with his entry marked with loud cries of "Jai shree Ram, Jai shree Ram" from his supporters. Later he told reporters: "Hanuman ji sabka bhala karenga (Lord Hanuman will bless us all)." Not just Arvind Kejriwal, but other AAP leaders-Sanjay Singh and Raghav Chaddha-who addressed AAP workers at the party headquarters on Tuesday, too resonated these identities, leading crowds to the cheers of 'Bharat Mata ki jai', and 'Vande Matram'. Aaj mangal vaar hai...Hanuman ji ka din hai. Hanuman ji ne aaj apni Dilli pe kripa barsayi hai. Hanuman ji ka bhi bahut bahut dhanyavaad. Of course, Arvind Kejriwal and AAP leaders are well within their constitutional right to do so. And that's exactly what would make the Rashtriya Sawayamsevak Sangh (RSS) smile. For long, the RSS has been trying to cultivate a culture where politicians (irrespective of parties) don't feel shy wearing their Hindu identities in public and also cheer along the lines of 'Bharat Mata ki jai' and 'Vande Mataram'. The recent comment of RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi puts this into perspective. "Hindu community does not mean Bharatiya Janata Party, and opposing BJP does not amount to opposing Hindus. Political fight will continue but it should not be linked to Hindus," Joshi said in Goa. Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary in Goa: Hindu community does not mean Bharatiya Janata Party, and opposing BJP does not amount to opposing Hindus. Political fight will continue but it should not be link So when a Rahul Gandhi takes a "holy" trip to Kailash Mansarovar just before Lok Sabha elections, claiming to be a "devout Shiv bhakt" who is a janeyudhari Brahmin hoping from one temple to the other, the RSS senses a victory of sorts. When a Shashi Tharoor talks proudly about Hinduism and slams RSS and BJP in his book 'Why I am a Hindu' for its polarising politics, the RSS, despite the attacks, senses a victory.""",
    """When a Shashi Tharoor talks proudly about Hinduism and slams RSS and BJP in his book 'Why I am a Hindu' for its polarising politics, the RSS, despite the attacks, senses a victory. For the RSS, the first stepping stone rests in creating an atmosphere where: (a) politicians aren't ashamed of wearing their Hindu identities in public life; (b) aren't shy of responding to the cheers of 'Bharat Mata ki jai' and 'Vande Mataram'. Arvind Kejriwal with his deputy Manish Sisodia and wife Sunita, offers prayers at the Hanuman Mandir at Connaught Place after his party's thumping win the Delhi assembly election on Tuesday. Once this stage is achieved, the next logical step would be to increase the decibel of these cheers. In this context, one should not be surprised that with the upcoming elections in Bihar and West Bengal, we may see another set of non-BJP leaders following the tracks of Arvind Kejriwal: Mamata Banerjee invoking Maa Durga and the Lalu Yadav's RJD reaping some electoral dividends from Tej Pratap's different avatars of Shiva, Krishna among others. Thus, while Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, Shashi Tharoor and others may try to rebrand themselves to counter BJP's Hindutva with their ideas of Hindusim, in one form or the other they end up playing on the grounds set by the RSS-one where the broad boundaries are set but individuals are free to customise as per local circumstances. The RSS has no reason not to be happy with this setting. At least for the moment, because a gain is gain, no matter where and how it comes from. Now that these leaders have consciously rebranded themselves as Hanuman and Shiv bhakts (and many will embrace others deities later on) the challenge for them is to see how distant can they travel without inching closer to stage two of the RSS agenda i.e. to make the cries louder and perfume it with one-upmanship.""",
    """How much policy of reservation is successful in our country? The main object of reservation is to uplift the poor and the down-trodden. But in reality, the experience of the past more than half a century shows that the policy of reservation has miserably failed to achieve its objectives. It is far from promoting harmony and spirit of brotherhood among the people, which is the goal of our Constitution. It is appreciable that financial help and other assistance are being given to the needy through the policy of reservation. But reality is that the policy of improving their conditions has made them dependent on crutches which mar their self-confidence. On the other hand, policy of reservation perpetuates injustice and disservice to the nation, because merit is thrown to the winds and its place is taken by inefficiency. In the light of the experience of reservation during the long span of more than half a century, it is quite evident that if the present policy of reservation is continued, the conditions of Scheduled castes and Scheduled Tribes will not improve much and up to the desired target, because it is absolutely not a right solution to improve their living standard. Moreover, reservation is creating injustice to deserved persons who work hard from their childhood and when time comes for selection showing personal worth and capability, it is ignored and in place, inefficient persons are selected under reservation. Here inefficiency under the garb of reservation takes the place of capable, deserving and efficient persons. All over the world, the stress is on talent, on merit and excellence. Our country is passing through a phase of development and we must not afford to sacrifice efficiency by giving preference to only those who belong to particular categories of backwardness ignoring meritorious and competent persons. The right solution to help and uplift the backward category is to make them competent through special primary schools at per with convent schools so that they can complete with other better students in higher classes and do not feel complex that they are given special favour through the policy of reservation."""

    """The term euthanasia comes from the Greek word 'euthanatos meaning 'good death. It is an act or practice of ending the lite of an individual suffering from a terminal illness or an incurable condition. It is also known as mercy killing' which is an act where the individual who has no chance of survival as he is suffering from painful life, ends his life in a painless manner. lt is a gentle, easy and painless death. It is basically to bring about the death of a terminally ill patient or a disabled. Euthanasia is thus practised so that a person can live as well as die with dignity. There are two types of euthanasia namely, active euthanasia and passive euthanasia. Active euthanasia or positive euthanasia reters to causing intentional death of a human being by direct intervention. It is a direct action performed to end useless life and a meaningless existence. E.g. by giving lethal dose of a drug or by giving a lethal injection. On the other hand, passive euthanasia or negative euthanasia is intentionally causing death by not providing essential, necessary and ordinary care or food and water. It implies to discontinuing, withdrawing or removing artificial life support system. PasSive euthanasia is usually slower and more uncomfortable than active. 5etore moving further, it is important to note that there is a difference between Duicide and 'Euthanasia'. In a suicide, a man voluntarily kills himself by stabbing poisoning or by any other mean. it is an act of intentionally killing oneself due to depression or other reasons.

    """Promotion of educational faculties in every country is a most important factor. Illiterate people are just like persons finding their way in the darkness, whereas education enlightens their minds and makes them easy to find their way in this huge fair of humanity. It is unfortunate that we have not concentrated on effective teaching in general and primary education in particular. First of all, it is the primary schools which demand proper attention by providing required infrastructure and sufficient number or competent teachers. We should spend liberally on primary schools in every respect. If students at primary school level possess adequate knowledge, they will surely perform well at high-school level and even at college and university levels. It is strange, in our country officers and political leaders at the healm of affairs regarding education systems, like to give more importance to higher education of university level by establishing more and more universities, whereas plight of primary education is miserable. Proper infrastructure in primary schools especially in rural areas is inadequate. Most of these schools have inadequate teaching staff and these schools are without even black- board and proper sitting arrangements. In most of the village primary schools, even required number of class-rooms are not available and two classes are being conducted in single room. Primary schools are just like nurseries. If plants in nurseries are not healthy, how they can develop after their replantation. Similarly, if students at primary school level come out with poor or adequate knowledge, how can we expect excellence from them at middle and high school levels. It is observed that there is unusual shortage of teachers in almost every region. Schools and colleges are being rapidly opened to please the masses, but these institutions are without building, infrastructure and regular & competent teaching staff, mainly due to non-availability of funds. As a matter of fact, government often seem to have given little priority to education. They usually appoint teachers on reduced emoluments or on contract, adhoc, and temporary grade on voluntary basis.

    """Medicine is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is "variable and inconsistent" for any condition, but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner. In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery. Medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology.
